	<h2>Rodneyâ€™s Life on the field</h2> <br> <p>Rodney is a soccer player who plays as a defender. Ngoh had quite a first season on the pitch, guiding the Saints to their most successful season since 2010. Playing in all 17 games in his first collegiate season, the freshman wasn't just a threat on the defensive end; he also played a crucial role on the offensive end during set pieces.He finished the year with a team-high six goals, four of which were game-winning finishes, ranking him tied for first in the conference with the University of Mary Washington's Riley Fisher. </p><br>
